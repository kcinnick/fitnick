not quite sure what this is going to be yet, but if I don't start writing something I'll never write anything. My view is being able to hit API endpoints like /steps/ and get a return of how many steps I've taken today or something similar, and long-term be able to use that to send desktop notifications about how many steps I've taken that day vs. yesterday, how many more I need to take to hit my goal, etc.
